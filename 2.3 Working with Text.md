# Data Types and Variables

## String Interpolation

While string concatenation is easy to read, it can get annoying to write. Another option is string interpolation. String interpolation was introduced in C# 6 and it enables us to insert our variable values and expressions in the middle of a string, without having to worry about spaces and punctuation.
```csharp
string yourFaveMusician = "David Bowie";
string myFaveMusician = "Solange";

Console.WriteLine($"Your favorite musician is {yourFaveMusician} and mine is {myFaveMusician}.")
```
Notice how we just have one string, which we append with the dollar sign symbol $. Make sure there isn’t a space in between the $ and the starting quotation mark ". Whenever we need to insert a variable, we surround it with braces {}.For more on string interpolation, [check out Microsoft’s documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/tokens/interpolated).

In older documentation, you may come across a slightly similar syntax. This style is known as string formatting or composite formatting. Since the introduction of string interpolation, it is rarely used. But in case you come across it, [check out Microsoft’s documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/strings/index#format-strings).

## Get Info About Strings

In addition to containing the value of a piece of text, strings also contain information about themselves. It can be useful to know these properties when working with strings. There are several built-in .NET methods that we can use to get more information about strings.

### Length

Since strings are composed of a set of characters, we can find out how many characters exist in a string with the .Length method. A common example is if we’re building a form and need to make sure a user submission doesn’t exceed a certain character length.
```csharp
string userTweet = Console.ReadLine();
 
userTweet.Length; // returns the length of the password
```
We append the .Length property to a string that we have, such as a user’s tweet.

### IndexOf

We can also find the position of a specific character or substring using .IndexOf(). This method is useful for searching to see if something exists in a string.

If it does exist within a string, the method will return the position of the search term in the larger string. Each character in a string has a unique position, like an address. Positions starts at 0 and increment by 1.
```csharp
string word = "radio";
 
word.IndexOf("a"); // returns 1
```
Since positioning starts at 0, the second thing in the string will return a 1. If it doesn’t exist in the string the method will return a -1. If we pass it an empty string, it will return 0. If it occurs more than once, it will return the first instance.

## Get Parts of Strings

We can also use built-in .NET methods to grab parts of strings or specific characters in a string.

### Substring

.Substring() grabs part of a string using the specified character position, continues until the end of the string, and returns a new string. .IndexOf() is usually used first to get the specific character position.
```csharp
string plantName = "Cactaceae, Cactus"; 
int charPosition = plantName.IndexOf("Cactus"); // returns 11
string commonName = plantName.Substring(charPosition); // returns Cactus
```
.Substring() is useful if we only want to use part of a string but keep the original data intact. So in this instance, we want to keep the string plantName, but just grab the "Cactus" portion of the string. We use .IndexOf() to find where "Cactus" starts, then use .Substring() with the position information to save "Cactus" to the new variable commonName.

We can also pass .Substring() a second argument, which will determine the number of characters in the resulting substring. For example, the following code shows how we can use .Substring() with two arguments to specify the length of our substring:
```csharp
string name = "Codecademy"; 
int start = 2;
int length = 6;
string substringName = name.Substring(start, length); // returns 'decade'
```

### Bracket Notation

Bracket notation is a style of syntax that uses brackets [] and an integer value to identify a particular value in a collection. In this case, we can use it to find a specific character in a string.
```csharp
string plantName = "Cactaceae, Cactus";
int charPosition = plantName.IndexOf("u"); // returns 15
char u = plantName[charPosition]; // returns u
```
Similar to the example above, we first use .IndexOf() to grab the character position, which in this case is 15. We then take the string value and append it with a set of brackets [] and place the charPosition value inside the brackets.

## Manipulate Strings

There are also built-in .NET methods that we can use to manipulate text data. Using these methods on a string doesn’t change the string itself, but creates an entirely new one.
ToUpper, ToLower

We can quickly change the case of our strings using the methods .ToUpper() and .ToLower(). These methods are useful if we want to make our text look like an e.e. cumming’s poem or make it appear like we forgot to turn off our caps lock key.
```csharp
string shouting = "I'm not shouting, you're shouting".ToUpper();
Console.WriteLine(shouting);
// prints I'M NOT SHOUTING, YOU'RE SHOUTING.
```
