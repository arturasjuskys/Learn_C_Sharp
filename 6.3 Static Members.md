# Learn C#: Classes and Objects

## Static Classes

We covered a few static members: field, property, method, and constructor. What if we made the whole class static?
```csharp
static class Forest {}
```
A static class cannot be instantiated, so you only want to do this if you are making a utility or library, like Math or Console.

These two common classes are static because they are just tools — they don’t need specific instances and they don’t store new information.

Now when you see something like:
```csharp
Math.Min(34, 54);
Console.WriteLine("yeehaw!");
```
You know that these are two static classes calling two static methods.

## Main()

Now that you’re familiar with classes, you’re ready to tackle the Main() method, the entry point for any program. You’ve seen it many times, but now you can explain every part!
```csharp
class Program
{
  public static void Main (string[] args) 
  {
  }
}
```

* Main() is a method of the Program class.
* public — The method can be called outside the Program class.
* static — The method is called from the class name: Program.Main().
* void — The method means returns nothing.
* string[] args — The method has one parameter named args, which is an array of strings.

Main() is like any other method you’ve encountered. It has a special use for C#, but that doesn’t mean you can’t treat it like a plain old method!

## Review

Congrats! You are now ready to use static throughout your classes:
* In general, static means “associated with the class, not an instance”.
* A static member is always accessed by the class name, rather than the instance name, like Forest.Area.
* A static method cannot access non-static members.
* A static constructor is run once per type, not per instance. It is invoked before the type is instantiated or a static member is accessed.
* Either of these would trigger the static constructor of Forest:
    ```csharp
    public static void Main() {
      Forest f  = new Forest(); 
    }
    ```

    or
    ```csharp
    public static void Main() {
      Forest.Define(); 
    }
    ```

* A static class cannot be instantiated. Its members are accessed by the class name, like Math.PI.
