# Learn C#: Classes and Objects

## Making Classes

C# provides built-in data types, like string: each instance of the string type has its own values and functionality.
```csharp
string phrase = "zoinks!";
Console.WriteLine(phrase.Length);
Console.WriteLine(phrase.IndexOf("k"));
```
In this case phrase is an instance of the string type. Every string has a Length property and IndexOf() method, but the resulting values are different for each instance.

A class represents a custom data type. In C#, the class defines the kinds of information and methods included in a custom type.

You can then make instances of that class (above, phrase was an instance of string). There may be many instances of the same class, all with unique values.

To begin defining a class, C# uses this structure:
```csharp
class Forest {
}
```
The code for a class is usually put into a file of its own, named with the name of the class. In this case it’s Forest.cs. This keeps our code organized and easy to debug.

In other parts of code, like Main() in Program.cs, we can use the class. We make instances, or objects, of the Forest class with the new keyword:
```csharp
Forest f = new Forest();
```
We could say f is an instance of the Forest class, or f is of type Forest.

The process of creating an instance is called instantiation. Today we instantiate a class; yesterday they instantiated a class, and so on.

## Fields

We need to associate different pieces of data, like a size and name, to each Forest object. In C#, these pieces of data are called fields. Fields are one type of class member, which is the general term for the building blocks of a class.

Create fields like this:
```csharp
class Forest {
  public string name;
  public int trees;
}
```
This might look similar to defining a variable. It is! Each field is a variable and it will have a different value for each object.

With the code above, we haven’t set the value of either field, so each has a default value. In this case strings default to null, ints to 0, and bools to false. You can find the default values for more types in Microsoft’s default values table.

It is common practice to names field with lowercase (name instead of Name). This makes fields easy to recognize later on.

Don’t worry about public yet: it’s explained later in this lesson.

Once we create a Forest instance, we can access and edit each field with dot notation:
```csharp
Forest f = new Forest();
f.name = "Amazon";
Console.WriteLine(f.name); // Prints "Amazon"
 
Forest f2 = new Forest();
f2.name = "Congo";
Console.WriteLine(f2.name); // Prints "Congo"
```
Each instance has a name field, but the value may differ across instances.


## Properties

As of now, a program can plant any value in a Forest field. For example, if we had an area field of type int, we could set it to 0, 40, or -1249. Can we have a forest of -1249 area? We need a way to define what values are valid and disallow those that are not. C# provides a tool for that: properties.

Properties are another type of class member. Each property is like a spokesperson for a field: it controls the access (getting and setting) to that field. We can use this to validate values before they are set to a field. A property is made up of two methods:
* a get() method, or getter: called when the property is accessed
* a set() method, or setter: called when the property is assigned a value

This shows a basic Area property without validation:
```csharp
public int area;
public int Area
{
  get { return area; }
  set { area = value; }
}
```
The Area property is associated with the area field. It’s common to name a property with the title-cased version of its field’s name, e.g. age and Age, name and Name.

The set() method above uses the keyword value, which represents the value we assign to the property. Back in Program.cs, when we access the Area property, the get() and set() methods are called:
```csharp
Forest f = new Forest();
f.Area = -1; // set() is called
Console.WriteLine(f.Area); // get() is called; prints -1
```
In the above example, when set() is called, the value variable is -1, so area is set to -1.

Here’s the same property with validation in the set() method. If we try to set Area to a negative value, it will be changed to 0.
```csharp
public int Area
{
  get { return area; }
  set 
  { 
    if (value < 0) { area = 0; }
    else { area = value; }
  }
}
```
In Program.cs:
```csharp
Forest f = new Forest();
// set() is called
f.Area = -1; 
// get() is called; prints 0
Console.WriteLine(f.Area);
```

## Automatic Properties

It might have felt tedious to write the same getter and setter for the Name and Trees properties. C# has a solution for that! The basic getter and setter pattern is so common that there is a short-hand called an automatic property. As a reminder, here’s the basic pattern for an imaginary size property:
```csharp
public string size;
public string Size
{
  get { return size; }
  set { size = value; }
}
```
This pattern can be written as an automatic property:
```csharp
public string Size
{ get; set; }
```
In this form, you don’t have to write out the get() and set() methods, and you don’t have to define a size field at all! A hidden field is defined in the background for us. All we have to worry about is the Size property.

## Public vs. Private

At this point we have built fields to associate data with a class and properties to control the getting and setting of each field. As it is now, any code outside of the Forest class can “sneak past” our properties by directly accessing the field:
```csharp
f.Age = 32; // using property
f.age = -1; // using field
```
The second line avoids the property’s validation by directly accessing the field. We can fix this by using the access modifiers public and private:
* public — a public member can be accessed by any class
* private — a private member can only be accessed by code in the same class

For simplicity, we’ve been adding public to every member so far. That allows code to access the members from the Main() method, which doesn’t belong to the Forest class. When we switch a field from public to private it will no longer be accessible from Main(), although code inside the Forest class — like properties — can still access it.

Access modifiers can be applied to all members of a class, including fields, properties, and the rest of the members covered in this lesson.

Remember encapsulation? public and private are necessary to encapsulate our classes. Think of it like “defensive coding”: you are protecting the inner mechanisms of a class with private so that other code can’t break your class. You only expose what you want to be public.

For example, since a class’ properties define how other programs get and set its fields, it’s good practice to make fields private and properties public.

C# encourages encapsulation by defaulting class members to private and classes to public.

## Methods

The third type of member in classes is methods. This lesson assumes that you are already familiar with methods, so the syntax should look familiar.

In the past you learned that methods are a useful way to organize chunks of code to perform a task. But most methods belong to a class (even the ones you have written!), so methods are also used to define how an instance of a class behaves. You can think of them as the “actions” that an object can perform.

This code defines a method IncreaseArea() that changes the value of the Area property:
```csharp
class Forest {
  public int Area
  { /* property body omitted */  }
  public int IncreaseArea(int growth)
  {
    Area = Area + growth;
    return Area;
  }
}
```
You would call the method like so:
```csharp
Forest f = new Forest();
int result = f.IncreaseArea(2);
Console.WriteLine(result); // Prints 2
```

## Constructors

In each of the examples so far, we created a new Forest object and set the property values one by one. It would be nice if we could write a method that’s run every time an object is created to set those values at once.

C# has a special type of method, called a constructor, that does just that. It looks like a method, but there is no return type listed and the method name is the name of its enclosing class:
```csharp
class Forest 
{
  public Forest()
  {
  }
}
```
We can add code in the constructor to set values to fields:
```csharp
class Forest
{
  public int Area;
 
  public Forest(int area)
  {
    this.Area = area;
  }
}
```
This constructor method is used whenever we instantiate an object with the new keyword:
```csharp
 // Constructor is called here
Forest f = new Forest(400);
```
But we’ve been instantiating new objects all day! Why did it work before we defined a constructor?

If no constructor is defined in a class, one is automatically created for us. It takes no parameters, so it’s called a parameterless constructor. That’s why we have been able to instantiate new objects without errors:
```csharp
Forest f = new Forest();
```

## Overloading Constructors

Just like other methods, constructors can be overloaded. For example, we may want to define an additional constructor that takes one argument:
```csharp
public Forest(int area, string country)
{ 
  this.Area = area;
  this.Country = country;
 }
 
public Forest(int area)
{ 
  this.Area = area;
  this.Country = "Unknown";
}
```
The first constructor provides values for both fields, and the second gives a default value when the country is not provided. Now you can create a Forest instance in two ways:
```csharp
Forest f = new Forest(800, "Hungary");
Forest f2 = new Forest(400);
```
Notice how we’ve written duplicate code for our second constructor: this.Area = area;. Later on, if we need to adjust the constructor, we’ll need to find every copy of the code and make the exact same change. That means more work and chances for errors.

We have two options to resolve this. In either case we will remove the duplicated code:
* Use default arguments. This is useful if you are using C# 4.0 or later (which is fairly common) and the only difference between constructors is default values.
```csharp
public Forest(int area, string country = "Unknown")
{
  this.Area = area;
  this.Country = country;
}
```
2. Use : this(), which refers to another constructor in the same class. This is useful for old C# programs (before 4.0) and when your second constructor has additional functionality. This example has an additional functionality of announcing the default value.
```csharp
public Forest(int area, string country)
{ 
  this.Area = area;
  this.Country = country;
}
 
public Forest(int area) : this(area, "Unknown")
{ 
  Console.WriteLine("Country property not specified. Value defaulted to 'Unknown'.");
}
```
Remember that this.Area refers to the current instance of a class. When we use this() like a method, it refers to another constructor in the current class. In this example, the second constructor calls this() — which refers to the first Forest() constructor — AND it prints information to the console.
