# Learn C#: Logic and Conditionals

## Else If Statements

What if we want to handle multiple conditions and have a different thing happen each time? Conditional statements can be chained by combining if and else statements into else if. After an initial if statement, one or more else if blocks can check additional conditions. An optional else block can be added at the end to catch cases that do not match any of the conditions.

In C#, we write an if..else if... statement using the following syntax:
```csharp
string color = "red";
 
if (color == "blue")
{
  // this code block will execute only if the value of color is 
  // equivalent to "blue"
  Console.WriteLine("color is blue");
} 
else if (color == "red")
{
  // this code block will execute if the value of color is 
  // equivalent to "red"
  Console.WriteLine("color is NOT blue");
} 
else // this is optional
{
  // this code block will execute if the value of color is 
  // NOT equivalent to "blue" OR "red"
  Console.WriteLine("color is NOT blue OR red");
}
```
In this example, the program checks to see if color equals "blue" OR "red". Depending on what color is equivalent to, it will execute the corresponding code block. If it isn’t equal to either of those colors, it will execute the else block before moving on with the rest of the program.

When using else if statement, make sure to pay attention to:
* Each else if statement gets its own condition: make sure to specify the condition an else if is evaluating. Just like an if statement, this condition goes in parentheses and if true, will execute what is in the code block.
* else follows else if: If you choose to include an else statement (it’s optional), make sure it comes after any else if statements you might have.

## Switch Statements

Using multiple else if statements can get unwieldy pretty quickly. Imagine writing an else if statement for every possible number of guests. And you invited 20 people. You have to write a lot of repetitive code, which is hard to read and prone to errors.

If it’s necessary to evaluate several conditions with their own unique output, a switch statement is the way to go. Switch statements allow for compact control flow structures by evaluating a single expression and executing code blocks based on a matched case.

In C#, we write a switch statement using the following syntax:
```csharp
string color;
 
switch (color)
{
   case "blue":
      // execute if the value of color is "blue"
      Console.WriteLine("color is blue");
      break;
   case "red":
      // execute if the value of color is "red"
      Console.WriteLine("color is red");
      break;
   case "green":
      // execute if the value of color is "green"
      Console.WriteLine("color is green");
      break;
   default:
      // execute if none of the above conditions are met
      break;
}
```
In this example, the program checks to see what the value of color equals. If it matches any of the specified cases, it will execute the code associated with that case. In C#, the break keyword allows programs to exit a block when a specific condition is met. If none of the conditions are met, the code inside the default case will run.

When using a switch statement, make sure to pay attention to:
* Cases: rather than writing out each condition, if we’re evaluating one value we use cases to specify different potential values.
* Braces: rather than each case having its own code block, the entire statement lives within one set of braces {}.
* Colons: to distinguish between different cases, we state the case value, followed by a colon :. The code that should execute if that case is met follows.
* Break: Each case code needs to end with a break keyword.
* Default: Every switch statement needs a default case.

## Ternary Operators

The ternary operator allows for a compact syntax in the case of binary decisions. Like an if...else statement, it evaluates a single condition and executes one expression if the condition is true and the second expression otherwise.

Here’s an example of a ternary operator in action:
```csharp
string color = "blue";
string result = (color == "blue") ? "blue" : "NOT blue";
 
Console.WriteLine(result);
```
In this example, we create a variable result and save the outcome of the ternary operator expression. The expression starts with the Boolean expressions (color == "blue"), followed by the ternary operator ?, then the two possible outcomes, separated by a colon :. The first outcome, "blue" will be saved to result if the Boolean expression evaluates to true, otherwise it will store the second outcome.

Ternary operators can also be chained, like else if statements. But careful! Since the entire expression exists on one line, it can quickly become unreadable.

When using ternary operators, make sure to pay attention to:
* Parentheses: we place the boolean expression that the statement is evaluating in parentheses ().
* The ? operator: make sure this comes after the statement and before the outcomes.
* Colon: This separates the two possible outcomes.
