# Learn C#: Methods

## Define a Method

Up until now, you’ve been calling built-in methods: methods that are available whenever you use C#. Sometimes you need a custom method for your specific program. In that case, you’ll need to define your own!

The basic structure of a method definition looks like this:
```csharp
static void YourMethodName()
{
}
```
We’ll skip over static and void for the moment.

In C#, it’s convention to use PascalCase to name your method. The name starts with an uppercase letter and each word following begins with an uppercase as well. It’s not required in C#, but it makes your code easier to read for other developers.

The body of your method goes between the curly braces: { }. Whenever the method is called, the code in the body is executed.
```csharp
static void YourMethodName()
{
  Console.WriteLine("Hi there!");
}
```
Just like any other method, we call it with parentheses:
```csharp
YourMethodName();
```
Look closely at the code in the editor and you’ll see that you’ve been defining methods all along! Main() is a method. Every time you run the code, the Main() method is executed.

Since Main() is already a method, we’ll define our own methods outside of Main().

## Optional/Default Parameters

To make our functions even more flexible, we can make certain parameters optional. If someone calls your method without all the parameters, the method will assign a default value to those missing parameters.

All you have to do is use the equals sign (=) when defining the method. In this example, punctuation is an optional parameter, and its default value is ".".
```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
  YourMethodName("I'm hungry", "!"); // prints "I'm hungry!"
  YourMethodName("I'm hungry");  // prints "I'm hungry."
}
 
static void YourMethodName(string message, string punctuation = ".")
{
  Console.WriteLine(message + punctuation);
}
```

## Named Arguments

Say your method has lots of optional parameters, but you only want to specify one when you call it.

In this example, your method has five optional parameters:
```csharp
static void YourMethodName(int a = 0, int b = 0, int c = 0, int d = 0, int e = 0) {...}
```
When you call the method, you only want to specify d. But calling the method this way would set a to 4, not d!
```csharp
YourMethodName(4);
```
Refer to the parameter by its name instead:
```csharp
YourMethodName(d: 4);
```
With named arguments, you can list them in any order:
```csharp
YourMethodName(d: 4, b: 1, a: 2);
```
You can also mix named arguments with positional arguments, but positional arguments MUST come before named arguments:
```csharp
YourMethodName(2, 1, d: 4) // a is 2, b is 1, d is 4
YourMethodName(d: 4, 2, 1) // Error!
```
Named arguments aren’t always necessary, but they can be useful when:
* a method has many optional parameters
* you want to differentiate between similar arguments

## Method Overloading

Say you want to use Math.Round(), a built-in method. You go to the Microsoft documentation to learn how to use it, and find at least 8 different versions! They all have the same name: Math.Round().

What’s happening here is called method overloading, and each “version” is called an overload. Though they have the same name, the overloads are different because they have either (i) different parameter types or (ii) different number of parameters. This is useful if you want the same method to have different behavior based on its inputs.

Let’s examine this concept with these two overloads: Math.Round(Double, Int32) and Math.Round(Double).

The first overload, Math.Round(Double, Int32), rounds the double to the int‘s number of decimal points
```csharp
Math.Round(3.14159, 2); // returns 3.14
```
The second, Math.Round(Double), rounds the double to the nearest integer.
```csharp
Math.Round(3.14159); // returns 3
```
In C#, when we say that the methods are “different”, we are really talking about their method signatures, which is the method’s name and parameter types in order.

For example, both methods above are named Round(), but one has Double and Int32 parameters, and the other has a Double parameter.
