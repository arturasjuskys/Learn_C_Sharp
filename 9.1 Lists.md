# Learn C#: Lists and LINQ

## Object Initialization

Our first way to create lists and add items took multiple lines:
```csharp
List<string> citiesList = new List<string>();
citiesList.Add("Delhi");
citiesList.Add("Los Angeles");
```
We can do it all in one line using object initialization:
```csharp
List<string> citiesList2 = new List<string> { "Delhi", "Los Angeles" };
```
We won’t cover everything about object initialization in this lesson, but you do need to recognize and use it.
* Basic construction uses parentheses ( ) and no values.
* Object initialization uses curly braces { } and the actual values go in-between.

If we need to add elements to that second list later, we can still use Add():
```csharp
citiesList2.Add("Kyiv");
```

## Count and Contains

We can check on the status of our list in two ways.

We can find the number of elements in the list using the Count property:
```csharp
List<string> citiesList = new List<string> { "Delhi", "Los Angeles" };
int numberCities = citiesList.Count;
// numberCities is 2
```
We can check if an element exists in a list using the Contains() method:
```csharp
bool hasDelhi = citiesList.Contains("Delhi");
bool hasDubai = citiesList.Contains("Dubai");
// hasDelhi is true, hasDubai is false
```

## Removing

To remove a specific item from a list we use the Remove() method. It expects the specific item as an argument and it returns true if it was successfully removed. This code removes "Delhi" from the list and returns true:
```csharp
List<string> citiesList = new List<string> { "Delhi", "Los Angeles", "Kyiv" };
bool success = citiesList.Remove("Delhi");
// success is true
```
If the specific item does NOT exist in the list, the method call returns false. Since "Dubai" isn’t in the list, success will be false:
```csharp
success = citiesList.Remove("Dubai");
// success is false
```
If you remove an element in the middle of the list, all of the elements will be “shifted” down one index. In the first example, the list was originally:
```
[ "Delhi", "Los Angeles", "Kyiv" ]
```
After the call to Remove("Delhi"), the list becomes
```
[ "Los Angeles", "Kyiv" ]
```

## Clearing

If we need to remove all of the elements from a list, we could iterate through the entire list and call Remove(). The easier way is to use the Clear() method.
```csharp
List<string> citiesList = new List<string> { "Delhi", "Los Angeles", "Kyiv" };
citiesList.Clear();
 
Console.WriteLine(citiesList.Count);
// Output: 0
```

## Working with Ranges

So far we have added, accessed, and removed single elements in a list. What if we wanted to add, access, or remove multiple elements at once?

In the world of lists we call a subsequence of elements a range. For example, this list has 5 elements:
```csharp
[ "first", "second", "third", "fourth", "fifth" ]
```
We can say the range of elements from index 1 to 3 is:
```csharp
[ "second", "third", "fourth" ]
```
Here are four common range-related methods:
* AddRange() — takes an array or list as an argument. Adds the values to the end of the list. Returns nothing.
* InsertRange() — takes an int and array or list as an argument. Adds the values at the int index. Returns nothing.
* RemoveRange() — takes two int values. The first int is the index at which to begin removing and the second int is the number of elements to remove. Returns nothing.
* GetRange() — takes two int values. The first int is the index of the first desired element and the second int is the number of elements in the desired range. Returns a list of the same type.

Here is each one in action:
```csharp
List<string> places = new List<string> { "first", "second" };
 
places.AddRange(new string[] { "fifth", "sixth" });
// List is  "first", "second", "fifth", "sixth" ]
places.InsertRange(2, new string[] { "third", "fourth"});
// List is [ "first", "second", "third", "fourth", "fifth", "sixth" ]
places.RemoveRange(4, 2);
// List is [ "first", "second", "third", "fourth" ]
List<string> newPlaces = places.GetRange(0, 3);
// New list is [ "first", "second", "third" ]
```

## Generic Collections

You’ve done great with lists so far! It’s time to take a look at the bigger picture.

Remember the one line we mentioned at the beginning of this lesson?
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
```
The list class is in a group of classes called generic collections. They don’t exist in the default set of System classes, so we need to make a reference to them with this line.

Generic collections are data structures that are defined with a generic type. Each class is defined generally without a specific type in mind. When we make an actual instance, we define the specific type:
```csharp
List<string> citiesList = new List<string>();
List<Object> objects = new List<Object>();
```
Imagine it like a set of general instructions: in a toy store, we can tell the employees how to add and remove items from a shelf without specifying the type of toy. In the same way, we can use Add() and Remove() without knowing a lists’s data type.

For this reason, the formal class name of lists is List\<T>. That T is a type parameter: it represents some type that we can specify later. The general instructions, however are neatly contained in the generic List\<T> class.

Let’s see why this is useful by imagining the other, more difficult ways we could create “generic” collections:
* Use type-specific classes, like StringList, IntList, etc. — We would have to make a list class for EVERY type, defining the same properties and methods for each list class.
* Use a list containing Object types, List\<Object> — Using Object means we can’t use any of the unique functionality of each type and it takes a lot of computing power to convert references to and from the Object type.

## Review

Well done! You’ve learned a lot of useful information in this lesson:
* A list, or List\<T>, is a generic, sequential data structure. The specific type that it contains is specified upon instantiation.
* Lists are effectively unlimited. They “grow” and “shrink” as the number of elements rises and falls.
* List values can be accessed by index using square brackets: [ ].
* To create an empty list, use a basic constructor. To create a list with values, use object initialization.
* Add() is used to add an element to a list.
* Remove() is used to remove an element from the list. It returns true if it is successful, false otherwise.
* Count is the number of elements in the array.
* Contains() returns true if the argument exists in the list, false otherwise.
* A sequence within a list is called a range. There are specific methods for working with ranges, including GetRange(), AddRange(), InsertRange(), and RemoveRange().
* Lists are a type of generic collection, which are defined with generic type parameters. The type parameters are specified when instantiating any generic class.
* Use lists and dictionaries in your code by including this line at the top of your file:
    ```
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    ```

If you ever forget the constructors, properties, and methods taught here, you can find them in the [Microsoft documentation for List\<T>](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.list-1).

Finally, you may be wondering: if lists have so many great features, why did we bother with arrays at all?

The answer is (this an optional part of the lesson): under the hood, lists actually use arrays! When we construct a list, the C# compiler constructs an array and stores the elements there. If the list gets longer than the array’s length, the compiler copies the list elements to a new, longer array. To the developer, it just looks like the list is infinitely long.

Thus arrays are faster to use when you have a pre-determined number of elements, and lists are better to use when the number is unknown or you’d like the extra features. If you’d like to dive deeper into this concept, start with [the Capacity property](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.list-1.capacity).
