# Learn C#: Methods

## Expression-bodied Definitions

Expression-bodied definitions are the first “shortcut” for writing methods. They’re great for writing one-line methods, like this one:
```csharp
bool IsEven(int num)
{
  return num % 2 == 0;
}
```
We can rewrite this definition as an expression-bodied definition by:
* removing the curly braces and return keyword, and
* adding the “fat arrow”, or =>, which is composed of the equal sign, =, and greater than, >, symbols
```csharp
bool isEven(int num) => num % 2 == 0;
```
This also works for methods that return nothing, aka void:
```csharp
void Shout(string x) => Console.WriteLine(x.ToUpper());
```
This type of definition can only be used when a method contains one expression. This helps us remember the name: expression-bodied definitions are method definitions with one expression.

Fun fact: some developers also call the fat arrow notation, =>, a squid! 🦑

## Lambda Expressions

The next shortcut, lambda expressions, are great for situations when you need to pass a method as an argument.

In the past exercise, we used IsEven() to check that an even value exists in the array numbers:
```csharp
int[] numbers = {1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8};
 
public static bool IsEven(int num)
{
  return num % 2 == 0;
}
 
bool hasEvenNumber = Array.Exists(numbers, IsEven);
```
When using the original definition (with curly braces and return), it takes multiple lines to define the IsEven() method and other developers will need to jump around our code to find the definition. With a lambda expression, we can define IsEven() directly in the method call. We don’t even need to give it a name:
```csharp
bool hasEvenNumber = Array.Exists(numbers, (int num) => num % 2 == 0 );
```
This might look similar to an expression-bodied definition. It sort of is! What makes a lambda expression unique is that it is an anonymous method: it has no name.

Generally lambda expressions with one expression (like the above example) take this form. They use the fat arrow, no curly braces, and no semicolon (;):
```
(input-parameters) => expression
```
Lambda expressions with more than one expression use curly braces and semicolon:
```
(input-parameters) => { statement; }
```
Here’s an example of the second structure, which checks if any element in numbers is a multiple of 12 and greater than 20:
```csharp
bool hasBigDozen = Array.Exists(numbers, (int num) => {
  bool isDozenMultiple = num % 12 == 0;
  bool greaterThan20 = num > 20;
  return isDozenMultiple && greaterThan20;
});
```
Since this lambda expression includes multiple expressions (3 in this case), then we must use curly braces and semicolons.

## Shorter Lambda Expressions

Time to put on our detective caps: using deductive reasoning, we can make our lambda expression even shorter. Here’s what we have to start:
```csharp
bool hasEvenNumbers = Array.Exists(numbers, (int num) => num % 2 == 0 );
```
The type of num is int. It’s great to be explicit like this to avoid errors, but some developers wouldn’t include int. To them, it’s obvious! Here’s their reasoning:
* The modulo operator (%) is only used with numbers, so num must be a number
* The result of the operation num % 2 is compared to the integer 0. We can only compare similar types, so num must also be an integer!

Therefore, we can remove int without causing any errors:
```csharp
bool hasEvenNumbers = Array.Exists(numbers, (num) => num % 2 == 0 );
```
When there is just one parameter in a lambda expression, we don’t need the parentheses around the parameter either:
```csharp
bool hasEvenNumbers = Array.Exists(numbers, num => num % 2 == 0 );
```
We just learned two new shortcuts “within” the lambda expression shortcut. Though we don’t need to use them all the time, we do need to recognize them in other developers’ code:
1. We can remove the parameter type if it can be inferred
2. We can remove the parentheses if there is one parameter
